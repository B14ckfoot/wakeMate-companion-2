## Auto-Start Configuration

### Windows

The Windows setup script creates a shortcut in your Startup folder to automatically launch WakeMATECompanion when you start your computer. The application will detect when your computer wakes from sleep and ensure the service is running.

### macOS

The macOS setup script creates a LaunchAgent that will automatically start WakeMATECompanion when you boot your Mac and restart it if the computer wakes from sleep.

### Linux

The Linux setup script creates both a systemd user service and a desktop autostart entry to ensure WakeMATECompanion starts automatically when you boot your computer and restarts when waking from sleep.
